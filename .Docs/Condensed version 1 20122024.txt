Ah, now I understand your question better! For efficient context transfer between chats, we could use a structured approach that preserves critical information while minimizing token usage.

# Project Context Transfer Format

## Core Architecture
```python
ARCHITECTURE = {
    'pattern': 'MVVM',
    'components': ['Core', 'Infrastructure', 'Presentation'],
    'key_features': [
        'Async Monitoring',
        'Plugin System',
        'Educational UI'
    ]
}
```

## Critical Systems
1. MWLL (Logging)
   - Decorator-based validation
   - Performance tracking
   - Method introspection

2. Plugin Framework
   - 7z format
   - Dynamic loading
   - Metadata validation

3. Command System
   - Async operations
   - Progress tracking
   - State management

## Development Flow
1. Initial Phase
   - Minimal window
   - Core infrastructure
   - Basic logging

2. Next Steps
   - UI Framework
   - Monitoring system
   - Plugin integration

## Outstanding Design Questions
```markdown
CORE:
- Metrics priority for monitoring
- Command cancellation strategy
- Validation granularity

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Testing approach
- CUDA validation
- Plugin sandbox design
```

Would this format work for carrying forward our context? It:
- Maintains critical design decisions
- Preserves architectural patterns
- Keeps outstanding questions
- Minimizes structural overhead

I'm particularly interested in whether you see any critical information that this format might miss or areas where we could be even more efficient with tokens.

Should we use this as our reference structure for the new chat?
